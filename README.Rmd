# aocfuns

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of aocfuns is to provide functions that sub in function definitions for functions I wish I had when doing [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/)

## Installation

You can install the development version of aocfuns like so:

``` r
remotes::install_github("EmilHvitfeldt/aocfuns")
```

## Example

Simply run the code as `aocfuns::function()` and it will modify the document for you
